# Zack Lovatt's Illustrator Scriptlets

A series of small, simple AI utilities to run via File > Scripts, or any other script file launcher.

Note that these all worked at the time they were developed; as AI has evolved, some may stop working. I'm absotively not liable if anything breaks; run at your own discretion 💝

## [Create Incremental Text Items](Create&#32;Incremental&#32;Text&#32;Items.jsx)

Prompts for start & end numbers, and creates in current artboard a text item consisting of each #.

For example: Entering '0' and '10' will create a new text layer for each number between '0' and '10'.
