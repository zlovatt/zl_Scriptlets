# Zack Lovatt's Scriptlets

A series of small, simple AE utilities for [kbar2](https://aescripts.com/kbar), [Tool Launcher](https://aescripts.com/tool-launcher/), [Quick Menu 2](https://aescripts.com/quick-menu/) or any other script file launcher.

Note that these all worked at the time they were developed; as AE has evolved, some may stop working. I'm absotively not liable if anything breaks; run at your own discretion 💝

## [Generate Font Weight Selector](Generate&#32;Font&#32;Weight&#32;Selector.jsx)

Looks at an existing text layer, and tries to create an expression to select

 - It will create a slider on the text layer, and an expression on sourceText
 - The slider will animate from 1 to the # of weights found
 - The expression will list all available font weights it can detect!

NOTES:

 - this may not work in every case. Fonts are weird.
